			<p>Thanks for checking out HistoBreaker!</p>
			<p>The concept of this game is that a Breakout level is constructed from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_histogram">histogram of an input image</a>.  Every block you destroy modifies the original image's histogram, and that change is applied to the image.  The game is made in HTML5.  I chose HTML5 to investigate if it was an appropriate replacement for Flash, and also to discover how image processing could be applied using Javascript.</p>
			<p>To start playing right away, click on any of the "Play Now" links to load up the appropriate image, or paste the URL to a different image in the text box and click the "Custom URL" button.  If you want to learn more about the project, check out the "Further Reading" section."</p>
			<span class="subtitleText">Requirements</span><br />
			<p>The most important requirement of HistoBreaker is an HTML5-compatible standards-compliant browser.  I recommend <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>, as this is what the game has been tested in most extensively.  However, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> should also work.</p>
			<p>It is also strongly recommended that you use a computer and a browser with a resolution of at least 1000x1000.  The game will still display on lower resolutions, but you'll be forced to scroll the page in order to see what you're doing.</p>
